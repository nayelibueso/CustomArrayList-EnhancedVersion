# Custom Array List - Enhanced Version 

This project builds upon the original 'CustomArrayList' implmentation by adding new functionallity and refinding the exiting
code using Test Driven Development (TDD). The goal is to further explore the internals of the ArrayList data structure while 
applying best practices in the unit testing. 

## Key Features: 

- New Methods: Added functionality for interesting and removing elements in the 'CustomArrayList'.
- Code Refinement: Refactores the code for improved performance and clarity.
- Unit Testing: Implemented tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

  This project continues to deepen the understansing of Java data structures while integrating robust testing practices to create
  a reliable and maintainable codebase.
